# Usage

This script geneartes a label for the following drawers. 
https://www.amazon.es/Stanley-1-93-980-Organizador-estanter%C3%ADa-cajones/dp/B008DHZXRC?

The idea is having not only a general name about the components thar are inside of the drawer but also the part name of each component.

Its required to have a storage location for each 3 parts. For example  I have 3 regulators asigned to  "LDOs" storage location.
This location could be child of a another location called "Drawer_1" for example.

Might be a little annoying to organize  each drawer on PartDb but the creation of labels is easier this way
